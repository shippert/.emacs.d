	       About the GNU Emacs Lisp Code Directory


Q. What *is* the Lisp Code Directory?
A. Originally it was simply a list, in tabular form, of various
packages of GNU Emacs Lisp code that had been posted to one of the
Emacs-related Internet or USENET mailing lists or newsgroups.  Later
it became a flat-file database and associated formatting software.
Today it includes over 350 entries, also contains entries for the
packages in the standard GNU Emacs distribution, and there are three
different software packages available for use with it.

Q. Where can I get a copy of the Directory?
A. It's posted periodically to the aforementioned lists.  You can
request a copy directly from the custodian, Dave Sill, via
dsill@relay.nswc.navy.mil.  It is not currently available via ftp.

Q. How can I get a copy of a package listed in the Directory?
A. Good question.  There does not exist a repository of all the
packages in the Directory.  The "contact" field in the database
indicates where one can find the code.  In the case of a package
that's part of the standard Emacs distribution, you probably already
have it in your $EMACS/lisp directory.  Most of the other code is
available directly from the author or poster.  PLEASE don't ask the
custodian, Dave Sill, to send you code.  If you're unable to find a
copy through the listed contact, post a query to gnu.emacs,
info-gnu-emacs, or your favorite Emacs group.

Q. What are the three formatting packages?
A. There's the original `format' shell/awk script, an elisp package
called `lispdir', and a perl script (called `format.perl' for lack of
a better name).  Format and format.perl both produce a tabular format
similar to the original pre-database Directory.  Lispdir is a little
more flexible.  It currently produces a full-directory report in three
different formats, two of which are tabular.  It also provides a
function called lisp-dir-apropos that pops up a buffer containing
entries that relate to a given topic.  Lispdir is the preferred
formatting package.

Q. How can I get my package added to the Directory or get typos or
inaccuracies fixed?
A. Hopefully all packages posted to an Emacs group/list are added
automatically.  If you've posted something and don't see it in the
next release of the directory, or you have corrections or suggestions
of any kind, send them to Dave Sill, dsill@relay.nswc.navy.mil.
