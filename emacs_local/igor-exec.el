;;; Commentary:

;; igor-exec (igor execution) provides an emacs interface for sending
;; and receiving commands from WaveMetrics' Igor Pro.
;;
;; Interaction with Igor Pro is platform-specfic, so a major goal of
;; this extension is to encapsulate platform differences and present a
;; single interface that works on all platforms.
;;
;; On Mac OS X, this module should work without any extra work since
;; the interaction depends on Applescript. This code has been tested
;; to work with OS X 10.6
;;
;; On Windows, a python script is used to interact with Igor. There is
;; no good built-in scripting language that will work easily for this
;; purpose. Therefore, a native Windows Python distribution and the
;; win32com module need to be present.

;;; Code:
